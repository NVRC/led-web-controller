# led-web-controller-abandoned

##*NOTE* This repo has been moved to IoT-web-controller where it will be rehashed in a less hacky fashion. 

A simple html and pure javascript controller hosted on the AVA-SH RPi.

I plan to extend the web controller to include support for all, if not most,
AVA-SH utilities.
